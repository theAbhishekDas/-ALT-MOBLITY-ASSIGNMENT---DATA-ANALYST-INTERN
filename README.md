## üìå SQL Modules

### üìÅ 1. Order & Sales Analysis
**Goal:** Measure performance by order status and time  
- `order_status` breakdown with total sales  
- Monthly revenue trends and growth rates  
- Average order value by status

üìÑ [`1_order_sales_analysis.txt`](queries/1_order_sales_analysis.txt)

---

### üìÅ 2. Customer Analysis
**Goal:** Understand acquisition and loyalty  
- Top customers by orders and revenue  
- Monthly new customers  
- Split between new vs. returning customers

üìÑ [`2_customer_analysis.txt`](queries/2_customer_analysis.txt)

---

### üìÅ 3. Payment Status Analysis  
**Goal:** Evaluate payment health and timing  
- Total payments by success/failure  
- Monthly payment failure rate  
- Average time between order and payment by status

üìÑ [`3_payment_status_analysis.txt`](queries/3_payment_status_analysis.txt)

---

### üìÅ 4. Order Details Report  
**Goal:** Build report-friendly output  
- One-row-per-order with payment summary  
- All payment attempts per order (for audit)

üìÑ [`4_order_details_report.docx`](queries/4_order_details_report.docx)

---

## üìà Sample Insights (based on mock data)
- Most revenue comes from orders in `placed` status, with high AOV
- Revenue peaks in Q4, showing strong holiday performance
- Payment failure rate rose in March due to gateway issues
- 35% of monthly orders come from returning customers

---

## üìå How to Run

1. Import `.csv` files into your SQL database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
2. Run SQL scripts from the `queries/` folder sequentially
3. Optionally load outputs into Power BI for dashboards

---

## üìä Optional: Power BI Dashboard

- Import cleaned queries into Power BI
- Create visualizations for:
  - Monthly sales growth
  - Payment success trends
  - Top customer leaderboard
  - New vs. returning order ratio

---

## üß† Future Enhancements

- Integrate customer segmentation (RFM analysis)
- Predict late payments using logistic regression
- Automate report refresh using Power BI service or Python scripts
